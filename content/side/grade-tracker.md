# Grade Tracker

This was made as a refresher for my Excel skills and web design (landing page) skills before the school year starts. 
But, its main function is to provide a resource for chapter brothers to keep accountable with their grades.
The tracker and site were made in 24 hours to prevent scope creep.

## How does it work?

It works by automating as many things as possible using Excel formulas to make entering grades and seeing how your GPA is affected as easy as possible.
