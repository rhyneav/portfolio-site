# About

![Rhyne Vlaservich](/img/me.png "Rhyne Vlaservich"){:class="profile"}

My name is Rhyne Vlaservich, and I'm a fourth year student who likes turning ideas into realities and making inefficient processes more effective through technology.

## Past

I've been fortunate to have been a part of some great things in my past through 
    my education at the University of Cincinnati, 
    involvement on campus as a Lindner College of Business Ambassador and Sigma Phi Epsilon brother, 
    and work experience at Assurex, Projetech, and Fifth Third Bank.

## Present

Right now, I'm a teaching assistant for IS3030 Database Design while taking 17 credit hours of information systems and finance courses. 
Additionally, I'm working on technology projects as vice president of technology for Lindner Ambassadors and serving as webmaster for the fraternity.

## Future

I still don't know entirely what I want to be when I grow up. 
However, I know I want to make things for people using computers.
The concept of taking an idea and making it into a polished product that anyone with a computer can use is mind-blowingly cool.
It is something I hope to make an impact on the world doing.
