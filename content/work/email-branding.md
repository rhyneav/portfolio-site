# Email Branding 

#### Projetech, Inc.

One problem that consistently faces a small company is having cohesive branding through different online marketing campaigns. 
While using new fonts, styles, and images might be exciting, branding and user trust is sacrificed.
This is why I decided to create a set of consistent email templates to be used with any of Projetech's online marketing.

These templates were tested with every email client and mobile to ensure high reliability. 
Once implemented in Pardot, the newly branded emails performed 4% better on average in terms of click through rate.

Email templates:

3.  [Marketing template with hero image](http://vlaservi.ch/projetech/emails/marketingStyled.html){:target="_blank"}
