# Landing Pages

### Projetech, Inc.

One way to to get more leads into the sales pipeline is to create landing pages that look good and coordinate with the company brand.
Projetech used landing pages with every type of marketing campaign: online emails, webinars, and even trade shows.
A lot of what I did with landing pages was to make them mobile responsive, comply with our SSL certificate, and make them easy to use.

I achieved the above by bootstraping existing pages and adding subtle JavaScript to new ones to complete the playful look of Projetech.

Landing Pages:
