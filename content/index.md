# Rhyne Vlaservich

Hi friend, you've stumbled onto my portfolio site! 
This site was made to showcase some of the things I've been working on through side and work projects. 
It also contains some more information about myself, contact information, and some external links to other sites I'm on.

## About this site

This static site was dynamically created using Ruby and Nanoc with each page generated from Markdown.
It's also mobile responsive with animated buttons and a menu overlay displayed at less than 750px width.
