# Abundance Springs

#### Freelance

Abundance Springs was a freelance project for a holistic health coach to have an internet presence and increase leads. 
It was built using Bootstrap for mobile first design providing a clean layout on every device.

Using PHP, several [call to action forms](http://abundancesprings.com/3-6month.html) are spread throughout the site that send an email to the site owner when a potential client fills out a form. 
Additonally, the [testimonial page](http://abundancesprings.com/testimonialsBlog.php) is built with PHP to make adding new testimonials through the back end user friendly with no HTML coding needed.
