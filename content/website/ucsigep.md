# UC SigEp

#### Sigma Phi Epsilon Ohio Theta

This site built for the fraternity is an ongoing project to provide the chapter an internet presence for active brothers, alumni, and potential new members.
It features [chapter history](http://ucsigep.org/history/), [current information](http://ucsigep.org/undergrads/) about the chapter, and [scholarship information](http://ucsigep.org/scholarship/) for those looking to join the chapter.
It also has a hidden resource center for active brothers containing bylaws, meeting minutes, chapter roster, and other important information.

It is maintained using WordPress for easy updates to content by exec members who don't want to have to code, and features a mobile responive design suitable for every device.
